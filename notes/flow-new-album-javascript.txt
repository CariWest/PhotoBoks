    71: returns if the listener already exists
    72: otherwise sets isListening to true
    73: creates a New Album Listener & puts it on the new Album button
      takes a callback
      90: takes the #new-album-form; when user clicks the #create-album button, it prevents the default & runs the callback
      76: CALLBACK: makeNewAlbum (binding "this", which is the AlbumCollection => has the view, isListening = true, and can listen for new albums & create new albums)

# PhotoBoks

##Description

PhotoBoks sorts a user's Instagram content into personalized photo albums based on hashtags. This allows users to sort their photos without losing their photos in the noise of a popular Instagram hashtag.

##Technologies Used

This app uses Ruby and Active Record for the backend. On the front end, the app uses Sinatra, JavaScript, and jQuery, with an emphasis on restful routes. The app uses AJAX to implement single-page aspects and improve user experience.

##Next Steps

I plan to implement the ability to follow other users. I also intend to allow users to authorize friends to contribute to a photo album; this way, groups can organize their photos for an event without worrying about creating a unique hashtag.

I also hope to deploy the app to Heroku.

##About the Project
I built this project over the course of a week during my time at Dev Bootcamp. The prompt we received was to "make something beautiful." I chose this project because it solves one of the frustrations I regularly experience with Instagram: the inability to filter out just my photos from a single hashtag.
